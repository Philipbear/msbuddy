Command-line API
-------------

We also provide a command-line interface for **msbuddy**. To use it, you need to install the package with the `commandline` extra:

```bash
pip install msbuddy[commandline]
```

Then you can use the `msbuddy` command to perform formula annotations:

```bash
msbuddy --input <input file> --output <output file>
```
