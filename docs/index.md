[**msbuddy**](https://github.com/Philipbear/msbuddy) is developed for molecular formula annotation in mass spectrometry-based small molecule analysis.

**msbuddy** is able to provide formula annotations for:
  * metabolic features with or without MS1 isotopic pattern 
  * metabolic features with or without MS/MS spectra
  * both positive and negative ionization modes

**msbuddy** enables candidate space shrinkage via bottom-up MS/MS interrogation, accurate formula annotation via machine learning and false discovery rate estimation.
Please refer to [our paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01850-x) for more details.
