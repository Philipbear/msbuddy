`msbuddy <https://github.com/Philipbear/msbuddy>`_ is developed for molecular formula annotation in mass spectrometry-based small molecule analysis.

**msbuddy** is able to provide formula annotations for:

  * queries with or without MS1 isotopic pattern
  * queries with or without MS/MS spectra
  * both positive and negative ionization modes

The minimum requirement for a **msbuddy** query is a single m/z value and its ionization polarity.

**msbuddy** enables candidate space shrinkage via bottom-up MS/MS interrogation, accurate formula annotation via machine learning and false discovery rate estimation.
Please refer to `our paper <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-023-01850-x>`_ for more details.
